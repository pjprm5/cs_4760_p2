Redo of project 2.
Within my infile I have 20 lines of text to test for palindromes. There are spaces, punctuaction, and alphabet/digits as well
to test. So I set my max children to be created to 20 and max children to run simlutaneously to 20 as well.
Infile entries are written either to palin.out or nopalin.out with their PID, Index, and String.
It seems like the max children to run simultaneously never reaches the limit I set on initial fork.
I did not randomize the wait time before entering critical section, just set it to 1, because it was causing program to stall.
Everything else is good afaik.
